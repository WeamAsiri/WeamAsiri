### Hi, I'm Weam 👋

I'm a Physics graduate from King Saud University. Studying physics taught me to ask the right questions and shaped my analytical way of thinking — a mindset I now apply to make sense of data and solve real-world problems.

🔍 I'm currently exploring my path — whether it's writing code to solve complex equations or acquiring new skills to become a sharper tool in any team I join.

📊 I’m passionate about turning messy data into meaningful insight and bridging the gap between analytical thinking and practical solutions.

🚀 Always learning. Always building. Always curious.
